<h1>Welcome to Wasabi!</h1>

<h4>Join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/6RyndeSAet">Discord!</a></h4>

<p>Wasabi is a <strong>monthly wiped</strong> server that wipes on the <u>first Thursday</u>
of every month. The decay rate in Wasabi is very low, but it still exsists, so just be sure to
keep your tool cupboard stocked to prevent any decay! The gathering rate on Wasabi is set to 2x,
meaning you will receive double from gathering than what vanilla Rust would give you. Wasabi is
a PvP server, but it is also very much PvE, with plenty of fun PvE mods to keep players on their toes!
Kill on sight IS allowed!
